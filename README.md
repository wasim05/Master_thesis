# Master_thesis: "Simulation environment for program testing with configurable processor model"
##In modern embedded systems, soft microprocessors have gained more significance as compared to hard microprocessors. Soft microprocessors are based on Field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) and can be easily reconfigured for any specific application and hence are considered more flexible and portable. This thesis presents a model-based design approach for a specialized soft microprocessor, an efficient simulation environment is developed using a graphical modeling tool LabVIEW. 

Developed simulator is for the application of industrial control and measurement systems that calculates performs precision-specific arithmetic calculations. Additionally, an interactive user interface is developed specifically for control application by providing multiple running and testing option

###Debugger_applications contains the simulation environment, depper sub models are reffered as Execution_model and ALU.
