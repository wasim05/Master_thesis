##In modern embedded systems, soft microprocessors have gained more significance as compared to hard microprocessors. Soft microprocessors are based on Field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) and can be easily reconfigured for any specific application and hence are considered more flexible and portable. This thesis presents a model-based design approach for a specialized soft microprocessor, an efficient simulation environment is developed using a graphical modeling tool. The target architecture is LiSARD (LabVIEW integrated softcore architecture for reconfigurable devices) developed by the Computer Architecture Group at TU Ilmenau. The developed simulation environment demonstrates complete LiSARD features and is efficiently integrated with the available functionality of the existing project. Furthermore, the Debugger application is developed to perform program testing by creating different test scenarios for the evaluation of the simulator. In addition to existing LiSARD functions, some new memory inspection features are also included in the Debugger model such as single and continuous execution of programs. The results achieved during evaluation shows the performance of the simulator and proves that similar results can be achieved in a simulation environment even without using the actual hardware.
